                E-commerce adoption varies significantly between developed and developing countries. While countries like Spain have embraced digital retail, countries such as Colombia still face adoption challenges due to trust, risk aversion, and preference for face-to-face transactions. This study investigates the psychological and cultural determinants of online purchase intention and behavior, comparing consumer responses between Colombia (a collectivist, developing nation) and Spain (an individualist, developed nation).

                The study used a quantitative research approach grounded in well-established behavioral theories. A total of 585 online consumers were surveyed using structured questionnaires—291 from Colombia and 294 from Spain. Participants were selected based on their recent experience with e-commerce (within the last six months) and were mostly university students aged between 18 and 39.

                Data collection was carried out through intercept surveys in urban centers (Cali, Colombia and Valencia, Spain), and only individuals born and raised in the respective countries were included to ensure cultural alignment. The survey measured several constructs: attitude toward online shopping, subjective norms, perceived behavioral control (PBC), ease of use, perceived usefulness, buying impulse, self-efficacy in online stores, compatibility, personal innovativeness in IT (PIIT), online purchase intention, and actual online purchase behavior.

                Statistical techniques including Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) and Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) were used to validate the model. A multi-group analysis was conducted to evaluate the moderating role of culture between Colombia and Spain.

        <div class="textFeldConclusionWrapper">
            <p class="textFeldConclusion">
                This study reveals that consumer behavior in online shopping is not universally driven by the same factors but is significantly shaped by national culture and contextual experience. <br> A key learning is that self-efficacy, a consumer’s belief in their ability to complete an online transaction—is crucial in developing markets like Colombia, where digital familiarity is lower. In contrast, for more digitally mature markets like Spain, self-efficacy is less relevant because consumers already assume this capability.

                Another major insight is the role of buying impulse. In Colombia, where consumers exhibit higher indulgence and short-term orientation, impulse strongly drives online purchase intention. However, this effect is not observed in Spain, suggesting that consumers in more individualistic or economically cautious societies may suppress impulsive behavior in favor of rational decision-making.

                The study also found that ease of use and perceived usefulness both significantly influence consumers' attitudes toward online shopping, especially in Colombia. When e-commerce platforms are intuitive and helpful, they not only improve user experience but also foster stronger purchase intentions, particularly in cultures where uncertainty or distrust in technology is more prevalent.

                <br>Importantly, the research highlights that online purchase intention does not always translate into actual purchase behavior, especially in the Spanish sample, where the relationship was unexpectedly negative. This suggests that external constraints, such as economic concerns, may override a consumer's initial intention, underscoring the complexity of behavior prediction models.

                Finally, compatibility between online shopping and a consumer’s lifestyle emerged as a strong predictor of purchase intention, especially in collectivist cultures. If online shopping aligns well with social norms and daily routines, consumers are more likely to adopt it. This shows that behavioral drivers are not only psychological or technical but also deeply embedded in cultural and social structures.

            <p class="textFeldConclusion">
                <strong>Consumer behavior in e-commerce is deeply influenced by cultural context.</strong> While universal factors like ease of use and usefulness shape attitudes, their influence differs across cultures: in collectivist, emerging markets like Colombia, emotional drivers such as buying impulse and self-efficacy play a stronger role, whereas in individualist, developed countries like Spain, rational evaluations—such as perceived usefulness and attitude—are more decisive. These differences highlight the need for culturally tailored digital strategies that reflect local values, motivations, and behavioral patterns.

                This study builds on established behavioral and cultural frameworks. Key theoretical foundations include the Theory of Planned Behavior (Ajzen, 1991), the Technology Acceptance Model (Davis, 1989), and Diffusion of Innovation Theory (Rogers, 2010), which together explain the psychological and technological drivers of consumer behavior. Concepts such as self-efficacy (Armitage & Conner, 2001), personal innovativeness in IT (Agarwal & Prasad, 1998), and compatibility with online shopping habits (Vijayasarathy, 2004) are critical to understanding e-commerce adoption. The role of national culture is addressed using Hofstede’s (2010) cultural dimensions, while Pavlou (2003) contributes insights into trust and risk in online environments. The primary data and analysis are based on the cross-cultural study conducted by Peña-García et al. (2020), which offers empirical evidence from Colombia and Spain.
