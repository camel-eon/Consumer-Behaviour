                    Consumer behaviour is the study of individuals, groups, or organisations and all activities associated with the purchase, use and disposal of goods and services. It encompasses how the consumer's emotions, attitudes, and preferences affect buying behaviour, and how external cues—such as visual prompts, auditory signals, or tactile (haptic) feedback—can shape those responses. Consumer behaviour emerged in the 1940–1950s as a distinct sub-discipline of marketing, but has become an interdisciplinary social science that blends elements from psychology, sociology, social anthropology, anthropology, ethnography, ethnology, marketing, and economics (especially behavioural economics).

                    In the paper "The Influence of User Culture on Website Usability" (Alexander et al., 2021), the authors used the following methods to gather data and assess the usability process:<br>
                    <br>
                    <strong>Sample and Recruitment:</strong><br>
                    The study involved a total of 200 participants, split equally between 100 Australians and 100
                    Chinese. These participants were recruited via an online panel, and each of them used a desktop
                    computer to complete the tasks.<br>
                    <br>
                    <strong> Between-Subjects Design:</strong><br>
                    Participants were assigned to use either a culturally native website (i.e., Australian participants
                    used the Australian government website, and Chinese participants used the Chinese government website)
                    or a culturally foreign website (i.e., Australian participants used the Chinese government website
                    and vice versa). This between-subjects design allowed the researchers to compare how users from
                    different cultural backgrounds interacted with websites that were either familiar or foreign to them.<br>
                    <br>
                    <strong>Metrics for Evaluation:</strong><br>
                    The researchers evaluated usability using three key metrics:<br>
                    <br><strong>Effectiveness:</strong><br>Measured by task success, which indicates whether participants were able to complete the assigned tasks on the website.<br>
                    <br><strong>Efficiency:</strong> <br>Assessed by the time taken to complete the tasks and the number of errors made during the process.<br>
                    <br><strong>Satisfaction:</strong> <br>Measured through a questionnaire that gathered participants’ subjective feelings and experiences about the usability of the websites they interacted with.<br>
                    <br>By using a combination of a controlled design, cross-cultural participant groups, and objective (task success, time/errors) and subjective (satisfaction) measures, the study was able to thoroughly assess how cultural differences influence website usability.
